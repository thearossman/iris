//! A streaming filter that heuristically accepts connections that look like
//! QUIC: on an expected port, not clearly another protocol, and initial
//! packets with (potential) QUIC short headers.
//!
//! Per RFC 9000, the first byte of a QUIC short header starts with bits
//! `01`: header form 0, fixed bit 1. Header protection (Section 5.4.1) masks
//! only the low five bits of that byte, so the top two are directly
//! observable and the low five are pseudorandom per packet -- a genuine
//! 32-value uniform source, which the entropy check below relies on.
//!
//! Three shapes count as evidence of QUIC (see [`Shape`]):
//!
//! - **Short header** -- `01` in the top two bits.
//! - **Long header** -- high bit set, a version Iris recognizes, and not
//!   Version Negotiation (`0x00000000`, which is no evidence the connection
//!   will carry a 1-RTT packet, and a shape length- and ID-prefixed binary
//!   formats hit by accident). Meant to capture connections observed
//!   mid-handshake and coalesced datagrams.
//! - **Greased short header** -- an endpoint whose peer advertised
//!   `grease_quic_bit` may set the fixed bit to any value on its 1-RTT
//!   packets (RFC 9287), so roughly half of a greasing endpoint's packets
//!   have it clear. Credited only once the connection has shown at least one
//!   unambiguous QUIC packet, and only when the datagram is large enough to
//!   hold a 1-RTT packet.
//!
//! For a datagram at least [`MIN_1RTT_DATAGRAM_LEN`] bytes, the short-header
//! and greased shapes together cover every value with the high bit clear --
//! the fixed bit only sorts a packet into one bucket or the other, and both
//! count toward acceptance. What actually filters non-QUIC traffic is:
//! requiring at least one unambiguous packet before anything is credited;
//! requiring [`MAYBE_QUIC_MIN_DISTINCT_LOW5`] distinct low-5-bit values
//! across the matched packets -- or one recognized long header in place of
//! that, since a 32-bit version match is stronger on its own -- which is
//! nearly free against traffic with a uniformly random first byte and
//! rejects protocols that pin their low bits (TURN ChannelData, uTP,
//! OpenVPN); and the window, fraction, and packet floor below, which set the
//! false-positive rate against that random-looking traffic directly.
//!
//! Greased packets are counted toward the entropy check: RFC 9287 greasing
//! flips only the fixed bit, never the low five, so a greased packet carries
//! the same per-packet entropy as any other 1-RTT packet. Masking to five
//! bits is what keeps that safe -- a TURN relay mixing `0x40`/`0x41`
//! ChannelData with `0x00`/`0x01` STUN collapses to two distinct low-5
//! values either way, still short of the gate.
