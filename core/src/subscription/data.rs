/// Interface for datatypes that must be "tracked" throughout
/// all or part of a connection.
/// Datatypes tagged with "track" must implement this trait.
///
/// Each tracked datatype can optionally be tagged as "track", which
/// indicates that the runtime should track which subscriptions require
/// it and drop the Tracked data if all of those subscriptions go out
/// of scope. This may limit how much the compiler can optimize the
/// filter predicates, but it is generally valuable if the datatype is memory-
/// or computationally-intensive (e.g., a list of packets) and is only needed
/// for a small subset of connections.

/// Can be requested in a callback. Represents the string literal
/// of the filter pattern (i.e., list of conjunctive predicates)
/// that triggered invocation of the callback.
/// This may be useful if one callback specifies multiple filter patterns.
///
/// Examples:
/// - Filter: "tls or quic" parsed as patterns
///   `["eth->tcp->tls", "eth->udp->quic"]`
/// - "tls.sni contains nflx or tls.sni contains hulu" parsed as patterns
///   `["eth->tcp->tls.sni contains nflx", "eth->tcp->tls.sni contains hulu"]`
///
/// Some "gotchas":
/// - FilterStr cannot be requested in a streaming callback (InL4Conn).
///   If you need FilterStr along with streaming data, we recommend defining
///   a stateful callback with two methods.
/// - Filter patterns may not be mutually exclusive; i.e., multiple patterns
///   can possibly match. Iris guarantees that stateless, non-streaming
///   callbacks are invoked at most once; if multiple patterns match, the FilterStr
///   delivered will be the one that matches first. Iris makes no such guarantee
///   for stateful callbacks. If you want to receive every pattern that matches,
///   if multiple match, define a stateful callback.
